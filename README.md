# POAPify - Proof of Attendance Protocol

This project, **POAPify**, is a decentralized application (dApp) developed as part of the coursework for **CCS6354 - Blockchain & Smart Contracts**. It demonstrates a Proof of Attendance Protocol where event hosts create events and attendees mint NFTs as proof of attendance. The system integrates:

- **Smart Contracts:** Developed in Solidity to mint ERC721 NFTs.
- **IPFS Integration:** Using Pinata to store event images and metadata.
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** A React frontend integrated with MetaMask and a Node.js/Express backend.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Attendance is marked automatically upon successful NFT minting.
